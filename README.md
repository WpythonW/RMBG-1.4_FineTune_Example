# Fine-Tuning Example with a Single Picture

## Overview

This repository showcases an example of how to fine-tune a model using just one picture. The primary purpose is to demonstrate the process and potential of model customization beyond standard applications, including but not limited to, facial enhancements.

## Getting Started

To begin fine-tuning the model with your specific dataset, please follow these steps:

1. **Initial Model Application**: Start by applying the pre-trained model to your input picture to understand the baseline performance.

2. **Fine-Tuning**: Proceed with the fine-tuning process to tailor the model according to your requirements. This step is crucial for adapting the model to new or specific tasks.

### Important Note on Model Weights

In `example_inference.py`, you will find the following line:

```python
model_weights_path = f"finetuned_model.pth"
```

Please update this path to point towards the model you wish to use for fine-tuning. Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the model could not be uploaded here. However, you can obtain the original model from the following sources:

- Original Model on Hugging Face: [briaai/RMBG-1.4](https://huggingface.co/briaai/RMBG-1.4)
- Author's GitHub Repository: [chenxwh/cog-RMBG](https://github.com/chenxwh/cog-RMBG.git)

## Acknowledgements

I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to the authors and contributors of the [briaai/RMBG-1.4](https://huggingface.co/briaai/RMBG-1.4) model. This project is purely an example to demonstrate the capabilities of fine-tuning and would not have been possible without their foundational work.

## Purpose of This Repository

The intention behind this repository is purely educational, aiming to illustrate the process of fine-tuning a specific model with a practical example. It is tailored for those interested in exploring the potential of machine learning models beyond their initial configuration.
